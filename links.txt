Encrypted File System
Chapter 3.  Encrypted File System
3.1. Mounting a File System as Encrypted
3.2. Additional Information
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 now supports eCryptfs, a "pseudo-file system" which provides data and
filename encryption on a per-file basis.  The term "pseudo-file system" refers to the fact that
eCryptfs does not have an on-disk format; rather, it is a file system layer that resides on top of
an actual file system. The eCryptfs layer provides encryption capabilities.
