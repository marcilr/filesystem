Glossary for filesystem


Deduplication - "In computing, data deduplication is a specialized data
  compression technique for eliminating coarse-grained redundant data,
  typically to improve storage utilization. In the deduplication process,
  duplicate data is deleted, leaving only one copy of the data to be stored,
  along with references to the unique copy of data.  Deduplication is able to
  reduce the required storage capacity since only the unique data is stored."

LUKS - is the Linux Unified Key Setup and is a standard format for linux hard
  disk encryption.  It has a lot of interesting features such as using a key
  on a removable disk, keeping multiple keys, and more.  This is the
  technology used by the Debian Installer (since etch beta3) and is quickly
  becoming a standard in the linux world.
